## What is R 
**R** is a high-level programming language that is extensively used by statisticians and bioinformatician. Additionally, it is an *interpreted* language, which means that any code written in **R** will be executed immediately instead of requiring compilation (as is the case with uninterpreted languages such as **C** or **Java**). 

Use of **R** has increased substantially over the last few years in large part due to the growth in data-mining and machine learning. Hence, knowing how to work in **R** is becoming increasingly important in the current data-driven climate, and will be the main language we will work in for analysis of genomic data. 

## Why R
Various features of **R** makes it attractive for data analysis. These includes the following:
1. Interpreted language, which facilitates rapid prototyping. 
2. Can be extended using *packages*.
3. Open-source, which means it is rapidly improving as people contribute to the code-base (as well as to the development of new packages).
4. Free, which does away with software licensing fees (which can be hefty). 
5. Outstanding visualization capabilities which allows publication quality graphs/figures to be generated easily. 
6. Active community of users and developers, which facilitates the ease of getting help from others.
