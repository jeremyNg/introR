 R is a language that is gaining popularity, especially in the recent surge in big-data analytics. Beyond traditional statistics, R also has a large user base in bioinformatics. Although not the fastest, R makes up for its lack of speed in the ease of prototyping and its flexibility. Learning to write programs in R thus is an important endeavor for one who will be extensively engaged in data analysis.
